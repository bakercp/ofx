## Compatibility

**Currently NOT Compatible with < 0.10.0, thus we have no stable branch as noted below.**

~~The `stable` branch of this repository is meant to be compatible with the openFrameworks [stable branch](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/stable), which corresponds to the latest official openFrameworks release.~~

The `master` branch of this repository is meant to be compatible with the openFrameworks [master branch](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master).

Some past openFrameworks releases are supported via tagged versions, but only `stable` and `master` branches are actively supported.
